The repository contains code for the Coodle project, made for Smart India Hackathon


The application consists of creating a new and simple visual programming language using code blocks for basic instructions.
Using these code blocks, we can write simple programs to draw shapes, solve puzzles, etc. We aim to teach children especially
in rural and poor households the basics of logic and programming in the form of a fun game involving code cards and a mobile phone.

We use a mobile application to take photos of the program made using blocks by a child, and
show visual output using animations on the phone. We can draw different shapes using programming
logic with this language, and we can also use it to solve puzzles using logic. The code cards consist
of easy to understand symbols which we use in everyday life such as move forward, move back, repeat steps ( loops ),
conditions ( if - else ), etc. This code can be used to move the character on the screen, and draw various shapes.
We have mentioned the examples in the following slides for a better understanding. The purpose is to teach children basic constructs
of computer programming using these puzzles, and shapes. We can teach fundamental concepts of a program such as sequential processing of statements,
conditional statements, iteration ( loops ) in a fun to learn, interactive and intuitive way

We also have a web application, which will be used by teachers to teach the coodle language using a computer.
