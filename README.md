With the exponetial rise in technology, there is an increasing need for
necessary basic education in computer science. There are several problems
that exist when it comes down to fulfilling this need. Firstly, most schools in
India don’t even have a proper access to desktops for teaching. Then, almost all
programming languages are written in english, thus restraining students who
don’t know english from learning to program and keeping them at a
disadvantage. Furthermore, traditional teaching methods tend to focus on a
particular programming language and its syntax rather than the art of
problem-solving. This makes the learning process tedious and the students are
expected to develop the problem-solving skills intuitively on their own.
We aim to teach programming to students in rural areas in a cost-effective way
that focuses not only on the programming language but also on the core logical
and cri􀆟cal thinking skills in a fun, intuitive and interactive way. We propose a
simple programming method using Tangible User Interface (TUI) which uses
physical paper/cardboard blocks to write programs. The solution consists of a
web/mobile application that takes snapshots of the program made by
arranging these blocks. These snapshots are then processed and displayed as a
visual output on the screen. We can draw different shapes using this tangible
format and use it to solve logical puzzles that are designed to be solved in a
minimum number of steps sparking critical thinking and reasoning.
