With the exponen􀆟al rise in technology, there is an increasing need for
necessary basic educa􀆟on in computer science. There are several problems
that exist when it comes down to fulfilling this need. Firstly, most schools in
India don’t even have a proper access to desktops for teaching. Then, almost all
programming languages are wri􀆩en in english, thus restraining students who
don’t know english from learning to program and keeping them at a
disadvantage. Furthermore, tradi􀆟onal teaching methods tend to focus on a
par􀆟cular programming language and its syntax rather than the art of
problem-solving. This makes the learning process tedious and the students are
expected to develop the problem-solving skills intui􀆟vely on their own.
We aim to teach programming to students in rural areas in a cost-effec􀆟ve way
that focuses not only on the programming language but also on the core logical
and cri􀆟cal thinking skills in a fun, intui􀆟ve and interac􀆟ve way. We propose a
simple programming method using Tangible User Interface (TUI) which uses
physical paper/cardboard blocks to write programs. The solu􀆟on consists of a
web/mobile applica􀆟on that takes snapshots of the program made by
arranging these blocks. These snapshots are then processed and displayed as a
visual output on the screen. We can draw different shapes using this tangible
format and use it to solve logical puzzles that are designed to be solved in a
minimum number of steps sparking cri􀆟cal thinking and reasoning.
