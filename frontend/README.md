# Coodle App Frontend
This repository contains the frontend code of the coodle application, alongside the coodle interpreter

To run the application in development, follow these steps

```
npm install
npm run start
```

And go to localhost:8080/ to see the canvas.

To change the code input, go to interpreter/sample, and add your own list of tokens to test diffferent code inputs as we have not integrated image recognition yet
